# The Pacific Northwest Rural Broadband Alliance: An Introduction
Who is the Pacific Northwest Rural Broadband Alliance and what do we do?

- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, we are [@BroadbandNW](https://twitter.com/BroadbandNw)
# Who are we?
We are the first non-profit that provides guidance an hands-on resources for the creation of multi-stakeholder community powered modern broadband networks, broadband co-opâ€™s, and consultation or partnerships with existing local ISPâ€™s looking to improve their operations and expand the service area with the integration of decentralized infrastructure.

As veterans of the telecom and tech industry with extensive experience and understanding of this next generation of blockchain-based decentralized technology that is revolutionizing everything from the core of how the internet operates, to all the ways we interact with it, and all the ways it touches our lives and runs the world around us.

Our forward-thinking model facilitates both the creation of infrastructure for fast and affordable broadband access to under-served communities but also fosters the creation of highly skilled, highly desirable, sustainable jobs, improves local businesses ability to grow and participate in the global economy, and attract outside economic development.
## Our Mission
We aim to work with communities in a variety of ways to meet them on their level and provide the resources they need to lift them up to where they need to be. Our model provides communities with three primary paths to build these networks and gain access to the fast and affordable connectivity that they need:
### Building Networks for Rural Communities
We work in close coordination with the community to provide the full service of building and operating these broadband networks, whereby we handle all the logistics of ownership and operation of the core network, while still leaving full ownership of the last-mile infrastructure distributed to participating members of the community.
### Working to Form Local ISP Co-operatives
We serve as the catalyst for communities to start their own autonomous broadband co-ops, as well as further providing them with long term guidance and any resources they canâ€™t otherwise locally source to ensure their organization and network are successful in continuing to grow and evolve to meet future needs.
### Working With Established Community ISP's
We advise or partner with existing local ISPâ€™s that are facing challenges in connecting hard to reach customers, helping them to improve their operations and expand their service area.
